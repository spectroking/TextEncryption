# TextEncryption

This application is our TextEncryption project. The purpose of it is to encrypt messages been sent between a client and server. The connection between client and server is a simple chatbox setup. The encryption method we used was the Vigenere Cipher developed by  Blaise de VigenÃ¨re. A brief explanation and example of the cipher can be found here -> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vigenere-cipher/.
